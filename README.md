Commit 2: Event Handlers and Event Listeners. Here I set the key and mouse listeners.
Notes: DX(horizontal) and DY(vertical) values, they represent the axis in which a pointer would move in a frame
They do not represent the absolute position. If a pointer moves from (0,0) to (2,1) DY would be 1 and DX would be 2.
They represent the DISTANCE ELAPSED between frames. In order to make sure they are always correct we must reset them at the end of every frame.
